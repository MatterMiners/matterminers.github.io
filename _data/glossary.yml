allocation:
  name: allocation
  description: |-
    The value of allocation is defined between [0, 1]. An allocation of 0 means a resource / pool / cluster has not been allocated, that means, no task is assigned. An allocation of 1 means that a task is assigned to a resource itself or to all resources in a pool / cluster. The allocation does not specify the quality of resource utilisation.
cluster: 
  name: cluster
  description: |-
    A cluster is a collection of pools. A cluster does have one specific scheduler and scheduling algorithm assigned that schedules tasks to dedicated resoures in the pools.
controller: 
  name: controller

opportunistic resource: 
  name: opportunistic resource
  description: |-
    Any resources available for but not dedicated to a specific task. This includes resources which are acquired temporarily, but not owned permanently. Strongly put, any resource borrowed for usage outside of its dedicated purpose. This includes performing a non-dedicated task instead of idling in the absence of a dedicated task.
overlay cluster: 
  name: overlay cluster
  description: |-
    An overlay cluster is a special form of a cluster. It is a collection of the integrated resources spanning the different pools in all available clusters, containing both opportunistic and static resources.
pool: 
  name: pool
  description: |-
    A pool is a collection of resources that are indistinguishable from each other.
resource: 
  name: resource
  description: |-
    A resource is defined by a set of parameters, e.g. number of cores, RAM, disk.

utilisation: 
  name: utilisation
  description: |-
    The value of utilisation is defined between [0, 1]. A utilisation of 0 means that e.g. none of the cores provided by a resource are actually used although the resource itself is allocated. A utilisation of 1 means that e.g. all cores provided by a resoure are used. Thus, utilisation defines the quality how well a resource is used.
